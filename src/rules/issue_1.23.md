### Description

Winshock vulnerability in 2014 was the first real example of issues arising when the available ciphers were not sufficient to secure communications years after the software was released.

While ciphers supported by software at the time of release may be sufficient at the time of release, that software must be updated to support newer and stronger ciphers as they become available and not wait for the ciphers supported to be proven weak via an exploit.
