### Description

When a web browser reports an error that describes Version Interference (e.g. Chrome `ERR_SSL_VERSION_INTERFERENCE`), this indicates that the we browser on the user's system has attempted to negotiate a TLS connection with the web server using a TLS version which is not known by the web server.

This is typically seen when new TLS versions are in draft status, recently released, or an attacker in-the-middle is present and altering the TLS negotiation.

This error is widely misunderstood to be an issue with the web browser, but it is merely a symptom that appears in the web browser when the root cause of this problem exists with the web server (or introduced by an attacker).

An outdated version (or miss-configured e.g. CORS header) of web server introduces TLS Version Interference errors for which it may be possible to change web browsers entirely (or upgrade/downgrade) to avoid the issues with the web server.
