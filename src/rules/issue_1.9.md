### Description

When information is sent between the client and the server, it must be encrypted and protected in order to prevent an attacker from being able to read or modify it

This is most commonly done using HTTPS, which uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, a replacement for the deprecated Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol

By default, most servers still support outdated and known vulnerable protocols, typically for backwards compatibility with equally outdated web browser software

This is known as an insecure default and could lead to trivial attacks against default or miss-configured servers
