### Description

Certificates should be treated as suspicious when they do not have a trusted Root Certificate Authority, as it offers no security characteristics of TLS built on Trust Anchor system.

When visiting a website that uses an suspicious Certificate it is likely the TLS connection is not secure.

Conversely, if a malicious CA Root Certificate is present in the trusted stores then all website that have a leaf certificated issued by this CA will gain the ability to eaves-drop on all unencrypted information, inherently due to the nature they are providing the means for the encryption inherently and are present in the trusted CA Root store.

Various servers will use different versions, i.e. an updated Debian-based server should include the latest Java JDK distributed by Debian which may not be either the same version considered to be the latest Java JDK distributed, nor the same on other operating systems.
