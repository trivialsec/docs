### Description

SP 800-131A provides specific guidance for transitions to the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.

This strengthens security by defining stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms. The standard defines a period to allow customers time to make the transition to the new requirements. The transition period closed at the end of 2013.
