### Description

A cipher suite is a combination of authentication, encryption, and message authentication code (MAC) algorithms

They are used during the negotiation of security settings for a TLS/SSL connection as well as for the transfer of data

By default, most servers still support outdated and known vulnerable ciphers

This could lead to trivial attacks against default or miss-configured servers
