### Description

Cipher negotiation can be manipulated by the client requester if an unwitting server configuration has not been defined defensively.

Not having negotiated a strong cipher is an indication of server willingly downgrading security when any anonymous requester simply asks it to.

This is not a mere exploit, it is simply showing the inherent weakness in the server configuration.
