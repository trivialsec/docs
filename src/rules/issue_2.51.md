### Description

When visiting a website that uses an expired Certificate it is likely the TLS connection is not secure.

Certificate rotation should occur before the expiry date. Some issuers can take many business days to supply a replacement, and deploying the replacement to live systems often requires planning and care.

If a Certificate will expire in the next 72 hours it is considered a critical risk, particularly if near weekends or holidays.
