### Description

Cipher negotiation can be manipulated by the client requester if an unwitting server configuration has not been defined defensively.

Not having negotiated a strong cipher is an indication of server willingly downgrading security when any anonymous requester simply asks it to.

By not providing any ciphers that are previously or theoretically suspected to be weak, you future-proof software security to the best current standard.
