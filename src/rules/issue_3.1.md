> "Refer to industry standards and best practices for information on strong cryptography and secure protocols (e.g. NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57, OWASP, etc.)"

Each evaluation that reports on PCI DSS 3.2.1 compliance includes references to publications and evidence to support the idea of general industry standardisation, for which is a term that is defined by the existence of these publications over time.
