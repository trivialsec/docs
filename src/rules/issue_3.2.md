### Description

In the prior versions the standard indicated that an organisation had to use the latest version of SSL, or at least TLS 1.2. In the new standard that specific language has been removed in favour of general industry standards that change over time.

Each evaluation that reports on PCI DSS 4.0 compliance includes references to publications and evidence to support the idea of general industry standardisation, for which is a term that is defined by the existence of these publications over time.
