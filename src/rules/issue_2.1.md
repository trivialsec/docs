### Description

The lack of any CAA records authorises normal unrestricted issuance.

It is recommended that you create CAA records for your approved CAs to minimise business impact. With CAA, you can minimise the risk of certificate issuance by unauthorised CAs and help create a more secure and transparent online ecosystem.
