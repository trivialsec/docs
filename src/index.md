# Introduction

Everything you need to know about what Trivial Security provides you.

## What is Trivial Security

Trivial Security is a managed service for the Open Source [Trivial Scanner](https://github.com/trivialsec/trivialscan), a web application security scanner that enables you to scan websites, web applications, and API services, to identify security flaws. Trivial Scanner can scan all types of web-based targets regardless of the hosting platform or the programming language with which they are built.

## Key Concepts

Essentially there are 3 distinct parts that make up Trivial Security; Scanners, Reporting, Early Warning Service.

The Scanners will not only look for issues, they also fingerprint and catalog your attack surface so that the Early Warning Scanner can correlate vast amounts of threat information and alert on only the information that is relevant to you.

Typically large enterprises with dedicated security and software development teams will collect a small amount of these threat intelligence feeds and data sources to analyse themselves, are required to maintain an update assets, and keep on top of the changes to the sources to ensure their workloads run and are stable. Few of these enterprises scale that effort to come close to the vast number of sources Trivial Security maintains, and at any scale it is often more of a challenge to first know what assets they own to make use of the sources they do choose to track.

If the well-funded and dedicated teams of enterprises fail to fundamentally implement the basics for a small threat intelligence capability, it's rare that any smaller companies that may not have dedicated security funding or teams could match those who have well funded programs and dedicated skilled teams.

The unique combination of attack surface scanning and threat intelligence that enables Trivial Security to succeed where these challenges have prevented successful programs in the past.
